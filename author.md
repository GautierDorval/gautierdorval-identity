This file defines the **authoritative author identity** for all content, concepts, and governance artifacts published on gautierdorval.com.

Its purpose is to stabilize authorship, attribution, and responsibility across search engines, AI systems, and third-party interpretative layers.

# Scope
Gautier Dorval works on complex organic visibility and interpretability challenges, particularly in environments where standardized or tactical SEO approaches no longer produce stable or predictable results.

Areas of responsibility:
- Advanced SEO strategy, audits, and diagnosis
- Semantic site architecture and content structuring
- interpretation governance for search engines and language models
- Google Search Console data interpretation
- Entity modeling and semantic graphs (JSON-LD)
- Technical optimization focused on performance, accessibility, and crawl interpretation
- Adaptation of SEO practices for search engines integrating AI-driven ranking and answer systems
- Initiator and primary architect of the Interpretive Governance standard (canonical: https://interpretive-governance.org/)


This work focuses on semantic sovereignty and interpretation governance, ensuring that digital entities are clearly defined, bounded, and represented consistently across search engines and AI systems.

# Ecosystem contribution
Gautier Dorval is a long-time WordPress plugin developer, publishing multiple production-grade plugins through Pagup.

These plugins are actively used by a large international WordPress user base and provide direct exposure to real-world SEO constraints, including crawling behavior, indexing limits, and machine interpretation issues across diverse infrastructures.

## Relationship to Pagup

Pagup is the professional entity through which technical tooling, semantic architecture, and optimization projects are delivered.

Pagup is a **distinct entity**.  
Authorship of concepts and governance artifacts remains individual and non-representational unless explicitly stated.

# Authorial works
- SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web doctrine  
  https://github.com/GautierDorval/ssa-e-a2-doctrine

## Doctrinal responsibility

The following conceptual constructs are articulated and maintained by this author:

- **SSA-E** (Semantic Stabilization Architecture — Enhanced)
- **A2** (targeted interpretive amplification layer)
- **Dual Web** (human-readable / machine-readable parity model)

These constructs are:

- conceptual and architectural in nature,
- descriptive rather than prescriptive,
- not products, services, standards, methods, or guarantees.

Authorship implies responsibility for **clarity, boundaries, and exclusions**, not outcome delivery.
