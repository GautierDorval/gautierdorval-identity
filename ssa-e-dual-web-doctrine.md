# SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web — Canonical Doctrine

## Neutral doctrinal formalization

The neutral and versioned formalization of this doctrine is maintained here:
https://github.com/GautierDorval/ssa-e-a2-doctrine

## Status
This document defines the official reference framework used to design web environments
that are correctly interpretable by search engines and large language models (LLMs),
while maximizing explanatory authority and AI governance.

## Purpose
To reduce semantic ambiguity and agentic ambiguity in AI-generated interpretations,
by making a website:
- explainable (explanatory authority),
- citable (SSA-E),
- interpretable without drift (A2),
- governable (policies, constraints, licensing).

## Core Principle
Governance does not create visibility.
Governance constrains interpretation once visibility and citation exist.

## Components

### SSA-E — Explanatory Authority
A corpus of stable, non-contractual, non-promotional explanatory files
designed to be safely cited by AI systems.

### A2 — Targeted Interpretive Amplification
Non-transactional files that guide interpretation and support observation:
- intent maps
- question clusters
- cold datasets
- public, non-binding roadmap

### Dual Web
A hierarchical file-based architecture combining governance, context and authority,
machine-readable by design, using canonical indexes, manifests, llms.txt files,
usage policies and explicit relations.

## Non-negotiable Constraints
- no commercial promises (pricing, availability, commitments)
- no autonomous action without explicit human validation
- interpretability before automation

## Version
SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web — canonical production reference
