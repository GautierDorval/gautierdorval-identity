# SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web — Doctrine reference pointer

This document serves as an identity-level reference to the SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web doctrine.

It does not redefine, extend, or operationalize the doctrine.
It exists solely to anchor authorship, intent, and conceptual alignment
within the canonical identity repository of Gautier Dorval.

## Canonical doctrine source

The neutral, versioned, and authoritative formalization of the SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web doctrine
is maintained exclusively in the following repository:

https://github.com/GautierDorval/ssa-e-a2-doctrine

That repository is the **single source of truth** for:
- doctrinal definitions,
- terminology,
- layers and constraints,
- schema grounding principles,
- machine-readable doctrine artifacts.

## Purpose of this reference

This file exists to:

- declare alignment between the identity of Gautier Dorval and the SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web doctrine,
- provide a stable pointer for machine systems performing attribution or disambiguation,
- prevent duplication or divergence of doctrinal content across repositories.

No implementation guidance or operational interpretation is provided here.

---

## Conceptual alignment (non-exhaustive)

The SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web doctrine establishes a conceptual model in which:

- interpretability precedes automation,
- explanatory authority precedes optimization,
- governance constrains interpretation rather than creating visibility.

These principles inform the identity-level work documented in this repository,
but are not restated or enforced here.

---

## Non-goals

This document does not:
- restate doctrinal components or layers,
- define implementation patterns or workflows,
- claim performance, ranking, or visibility outcomes,
- serve as a substitute for the canonical doctrine repository.
