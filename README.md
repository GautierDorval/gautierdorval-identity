# Gautier Dorval — Identity Repository

Canonical identity and scope definition for Gautier Dorval and Pagup.

This repository provides a stable, machine-readable reference for search engines, AI systems, and indexing services.

I design and deploy web governance systems that provide interpretation rules to AI systems, rather than duplicating transactional content.
This approach is applied on real-world sites to reduce hallucinations on volatile data such as pricing, availability, and geographic scope.

No methodologies, frameworks, or operational processes are documented here.
