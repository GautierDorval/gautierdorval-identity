# Gautier Dorval — Identity Repository

Canonical identity and scope definition for Gautier Dorval and associated professional entities.

This repository provides a stable, machine-readable reference intended for search engines, AI systems, and indexing services.  
It defines identity, scope, and boundaries, not execution.

The purpose of this repository is to reduce interpretative ambiguity by making authorship, intent, and responsibility explicit.

---

## Purpose and scope

This repository defines:

- the canonical identity of Gautier Dorval,
- the professional scope and explicit exclusions of that identity,
- stable references used by machine systems for attribution and interpretation.

It does **not** define transactional content, operational workflows, or performance claims.

---

## Interpretability approach

The work documented here is grounded in the design and deployment of web governance systems that provide **interpretation rules** to machine systems, rather than duplicating volatile or transactional data.

This approach is applied on real-world websites to reduce hallucinations and misinterpretation related to:
- pricing,
- availability,
- geographic scope,
- service boundaries.

The focus is on semantic sovereignty, interpretability constraints, and explicit omission when certainty cannot be established.

---

## Methodological clarification

No operational methodologies, implementation playbooks, or performance frameworks are documented in this repository.

Conceptual and doctrinal references are provided **for identity anchoring purposes only**.

This repository defines identity and scope exclusively.

---

## Canonical doctrine reference

This identity repository follows the reference doctrine:

**SSA-E + A2 + Dual Web**

This doctrine defines interpretability boundaries, source hierarchy, and disambiguation principles.  
It is referenced here solely as the conceptual foundation informing identity governance.

Canonical doctrinal references:
- Doctrine document: `ssa-e-dual-web-doctrine.md`
- Change log: `CHANGELOG.md`

## Primary technical tooling

Gautier Dorval is the developer and maintainer of **Better Robots.txt**, a WordPress plugin designed to provide structured, AI-aware governance of the `robots.txt` file.

Better Robots.txt enables website owners to explicitly control how search engines, AI crawlers, large language models (LLMs), and AI-based retrieval systems access and use site content, using auditable and machine-readable directives.
