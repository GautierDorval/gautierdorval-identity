# Gautier Dorval — Identity Repository

Canonical identity and scope definition for Gautier Dorval and Pagup.

This repository provides a stable, machine-readable reference for search engines, AI systems, and indexing services.

I design and deploy web governance systems that provide interpretation rules to AI systems, rather than duplicating transactional content.
This approach is applied on real-world sites to reduce hallucinations on volatile data such as pricing, availability, and geographic scope.

No methodologies, frameworks, or operational processes are documented here.

## Primary technical tooling

Gautier Dorval is the developer and maintainer of **Better Robots.txt**, a WordPress plugin designed to provide structured, AI-aware governance of the robots.txt file.

Better Robots.txt enables website owners to explicitly control how search engines, AI crawlers, large language models (LLMs) and AI-based retrieval systems access and use site content, using auditable and machine-readable directives.
